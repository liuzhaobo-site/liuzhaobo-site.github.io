I occasionally get asked to give presentations on topics that are not directly connected to a manuscript/working paper. I put a link to those here for posterity. An astute reader will note that the underlying code for these presentations exists in [a subdirectory on the Github repository for my website](https://github.com/svmiller/svmiller.github.io/tree/master/presentations).

### [Intermediate Quantitative Social Research: A Course Proposal](http://svmiller.com/presentations/intermediate-quant/intermediate-quant.pdf)

This is a presentation that outlines a course proposal on intermediate quantitative methods. It draws reference to a few things. First, [here's the Github repository of this presentation for reproducibility](https://github.com/svmiller/svmiller.github.io/tree/master/presentations/intermediate-quant) (i.e. students can do these things as I did them). Do note that this presentation also leans on a few R packages, prominently my suite of R packages. These include [`{stevetemplates}`](http://svmiller.com/stevetemplates/), [`{stevemisc}`](http://svmiller.com/stevemisc/), and [`{stevedata}`](http://svmiller.com/stevedata/). Of note: [`{steveproj}`](http://svmiller.com/steveproj/) would be a better use of `{stevetemplates}` in Rstudio than just the single Word template I mention (but space/time considerations mean I can't discuss LaTeX installations or [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)). The example I use is derived from [a post on my blog](http://svmiller.com/blog/2020/03/what-explains-british-attitudes-toward-immigration-a-pedagogical-example/).



### [Quantifying the Gender Pay Gap in the United States: Two Different Paths to the Same Inference](http://svmiller.com/presentations/gender-pay-gap-permutations/gender-pay-gap-permutations.pdf)

This is a presentation on two different means to the same kind of statistical inference. The application is the gender pay gap in the United States. Another version of basically the same topic/analysis is available [on my blog](http://svmiller.com/blog/2020/10/inference-permutations-gender-pay-gap-general-social-survey/).


### [What Do We Know About British Attitudes Toward Immigration? A Pedagogical Exercise of Regression](http://svmiller.com/presentations/ukg-immig/ukg-immig-presentation.pdf)

This is a presentation on how to use regression to answer an important social/political topic of interest. The application is attitudes toward immigrants in the United Kingdom. This presentation is derived from [a post on my blog](http://svmiller.com/blog/2020/03/what-explains-british-attitudes-toward-immigration-a-pedagogical-example/).
