I've been a dedicated Linux user since 2005 and made the final switch from Stata to R for statistical analyses in 2012. There are always some configuration issues involved in getting a setup with which I'm comfortable, but I ultimately find it. However, this becomes a bit of a headache when I get a new computer and have to figure out how exactly I did what I did.

Consider this mostly a note to myself on tailoring a Linux installation (preferred: Ubuntu and its derivatives like Linux Mint) to my preferred workflow. Others may find it useful but this is mostly for an audience of one (i.e. me) so that I can remember what I did the next time I have to install a brand new Linux distribution.

## Install These Packages Before Installing R {#requiredpackages}

Linux users, unlike Mac or Windows users, will need to install some other packages from the package repository in (Ubuntu) Linux before several R packages will work. Basically, make sure to install these packages in the command line before trying to do anything in R.

# ADD libssl for Rstudio
# ADD cmake for nloptr
# ADD libfontconfig1-dev for systemfonts for kableExtra
# ADD libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev for textshaping for pkgdown
# ADD libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev  for ragg for pkgdown

```shell
sudo apt install curl libcurl4 libssl-dev libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libgit2-dev libssl cmake libfontconfig1-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev
```

You'll need `curl` for R Open, which I used to use before version 4.0 of R. `libssl-dev` and `libxml2-dev` are required for the `{openssl}` and `{xml2}` packages in R, which are required packages for `{tidyverse}`. `libcurl4-openssl-dev` is required for `{RCurl}`, which `{brms}` requires for statistical modeling in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/). You'll need need `libgit2-dev` for the `{git2r}` package in R, the extent to which `{git2r}` is required for the `devtools` package. `{nloptr}` depends on `cmake`. `{kableExtra}` requires `{systemfonts}`, which in turn requires `libfontconfig1-dev` on Ubuntu. `{pkgdown}` has a similar intermediate requirement. It requires `{textshaping}`, which in turn requires `libharfbuzz-dev` and `libfribidi-dev`. It also requires `{ragg}`, which needs `libfreetype6-dev`, `libpng-dev`, `libtiff5-dev`, and `libjpeg-dev`. Thinking ahead, you'll need `libssl` for installing Rstudio as well.

Install these packages before installing R or trying to install your favorite packages in R and you'll ensure there are no package installation problems. I will probably revisit this and update it when I find another Linux package required for another R package.

## Getting Stan to Run on Ubuntu With Your Makevars File {#makevars}

I forget why this keeps happening but a Stan model won't compile in R out the box. There will be an error that reads something like "C++14 standard requested but CXX14 is not defined", but the fix requires just one line of code. Create a blank document and copy-paste the following into it.

```c
CXX14 = g++ -std=c++1y -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-function -fPIC
```

Save that file as `Makevars` and drop it into a `.R` folder in the home directory. Restart R/Rstudio if necessary but that should do it.

## Alternate Between Microsoft R Open and Vanilla R {#alternater}

I'll occasionally alternate between Microsoft R Open (my default R) and vanilla R that I installed from [the official R repository for Ubuntu](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/). However, they install in different locations. Microsoft R Open installs to `/usr/bin/R` while vanilla R installs to a more convoluted directory of `/usr/lib/R/bin/R`. This arrangement means Microsoft R Open is the default R given its location in `/usr/bin/R`. It'll be the first command found when scanning the /usr directory. 

This too is an easy thing to change. Open the `.bashrc` file in the home directory or, better yet, the `.bash_aliases` file in the home directory if there is one. Enter the following line for when you want vanilla R in lieu of Microsoft R Open.

```shell
alias R='/usr/lib/R/bin/R'
```

This change will appear when you call R in the terminal. However, Rstudio will still want to point to Microsoft R Open. To get Rstudio to point to vanilla R, add the following line to the `.profile` file (again in the home directory).

```shell
export RSTUDIO_WHICH_R='/usr/lib/R/bin/R'
```

Logging out and logging back in should be sufficient to finalize these changes. Undoing these is as simple as commenting out those lines in the respective files and logging out/in again.

## Make Underscored Directories Come First in Case-Insensitive Directory Listing {#bettersort}

Clemson University bought me a new laptop ([Lenovo Thinkpad P52s](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-p/ThinkPad-P52s/p/22TP2WPP52S)) this summer. It was one of those situations where the university stipulated 1) I must get a new laptop because the money is allocated for this and no other purpose even if it is not a purchase I wanted or expected (kind of like [this situation](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/12/18/congress-again-buys-abrams-tanks-the-army-doesnt-want.html)) and 2) it must not cost more than $2,000. I'm normally a Macbook user, so this priced me out of a Macbook Pro. Truth is, though, I'm not sure I even wanted another Macbook anyway because [the newer models look completely unappealing](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/823pa9/i_hate_the_new_macbooks_produced_after_2015/) for the price tag. So, after our college's IT guy had a falling out trying to communicate with Dell, I got a new Lenovo Thinkpad P52s.

Unrelated to that aside, Mac's Finder (i.e. its file manager application) defaults to putting underscore directories first before a case-insensitive alphanumeric sort. I like that default a lot. Jekyll users will recognize that underscored directories coincide with important directories that [contain site content](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/). I've started to extend that logic to my R projects, creating directories for `_cache` (code chunks) and `_figs` (document figures) that I keep elevated in a list view in my file manager. However, that option is nowhere a default in the [various system locales](https://www.tecmint.com/set-system-locales-in-linux/) on Linux. `LC_COLLATE=C` will list underscored directories first before directories that start with a number or letter, but it is a case-sensitive setting that elevates uppercase directories above lowercase directories. That might work for some people, but it would make my sprawling Dropbox directory unnavigable. 

The good news is there's a simple way to do this that leans on the default (American) locale of `en_US.utf8`. It requires a few sudo commands and edits in a text editor.

```shell
cd /usr/share/i18n/locales
sudo cp en_US en_US_edited # make a copy of en_US
sudo cp iso14651_t1 iso14651_t1_edited # make a copy of iso14651_t1
sudo cp iso14651_t1_common iso14651_t1_common_edited # make a copy of iso14651_t1_common
```

Next, open `en_US_edited` in a text editor (e.g. `sudo gedit en_US_edited`, if you're in the directory) and find the line where you see `copy "iso14651_t1"`. Change that to `copy "iso14651_t1_edited"` and save the file.

Then, open `iso14651_t1_edited` as you did before with a sudo command. Find the line that reads `copy "iso14651_t1_common"`. Change that to `copy "iso14651_t1_common_edited"` and save.

Thereafter, open `iso14651_t1_common_edited` and scroll down a bit until you see this line:

```
<U005F> IGNORE;IGNORE;IGNORE;<U005F> # 33 _
```

Change that to this:

```
<U005F> <RES-1>;IGNORE;IGNORE;<U005F> # 33 _
```

The last set of steps will involve getting your Linux setup to recognize this new (modified) locale. Open `/etc/locale.gen` in a text editor with a sudo command and add a line that reads `en_US_edited.UTF-8 UTF-8` somewhere as a new line. Save that and run the following commands to finalize what you did.

```shell
sudo locale-gen
validlocale en_US_edited.UTF-8
sudo localectl set-locale LANG=en_US_edited.utf8
```

Finally, reboot the system (not just logout) for the changes to take effect.
