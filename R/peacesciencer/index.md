This serves as a simple index page for some information about remote data available for download in [`{peacesciencer}`](http://svmiller.com/peacesciencer/). CRAN has a size requirement---5 MB for the whole package---that can be restrictive for a package that aims to do as many things as `{peacesciencer}`. This will concern some data sets of interest for users. These are always the largest files in an R package.

## How {peacesciencer} Informs You About These Data for Download

First, open R and load `{peacesciencer}` into the session. If you are greeted with a message about extra data for download, it's because you just downloaded/updated the package and don't have these data right now. A simple call of `download_extdata()` will accomplish this.

```r
library(peacesciencer)
# ^ if you just downloaded/updated the package, you'll be 
#   greeted with a message about remote data for download.
?download_extdata() 
# ^ for more information about what's available to download
download_extdata() 
# ^ downloaded the data, also gives a message about where
#   these data were downloaded.
```

## Data for Remote Download

`download_extdata()` will download the following data sets into the `extdata` subdirectory for the package.

### Correlates of War Dyadic Trade Data Set (v. 4.0) [[`cow_trade_ddy.rds`](http://svmiller.com/R/peacesciencer/cow_trade_ddy.rds)]

These are directed dyad-year-level data for national trade from the Correlates of War project. The trade values presented here have been rounded to three decimal points to conserve space. The data downloaded by this function are about 4.1 megabytes in size.

### Directed Leader Dyad-Year Data, 1870-2015 (CoW States) [[`cow_dir_leader_dyad_years.rds`](http://svmiller.com/R/peacesciencer/cow_dir_leader_dyad_years.rds)]

These are all directed leader dyad-year data from 1870-2015. Data come from the Archigos data (version 4.1). The data are standardized to just those observations where both leaders and states appear in the CoW state system data. The data downloaded by this function are about 2 megabytes in size.

### Directed Leader Dyad-Year Data, 1870-2015 (Gleditsch-Ward States) [[`gw_dir_leader_dyad_years.rds`](http://svmiller.com/R/peacesciencer/gw_dir_leader_dyad_years.rds)]

These are all directed leader dyad-year data from 1870-2015. Data come from the Archigos data (version 4.1). The data represent every possible dyadic leader-pairing in the Archigos data (which is denominated in the Gleditsch-Ward system), but standardizes leader dyad-years to Gleditsch-Ward state system dates. The data downloaded by this function are about 2.2 megabytes in size.

### Chance-Corrected Measures of Foreign Policy Similarity (FPSIM, v. 2) [[`dyadic_fp_similarity.rds`](http://svmiller.com/R/peacesciencer/dyadic_fp_similarity.rds)]

The FPSIM data set provides measures of foreign policy similarity of dyads based on alliance ties (Correlates of War, version 4.1) and UN General Assembly voting (Voeten, version 17) for all members of the Correlates of War state system. The alliance data cover the time period from 1816 to 2012, and the UN voting data from 1946 to 2015. The similarity measures include various versions of Ritter and Signorino's "S" (weighted/non-weighted by material capabilities; squared/absolute distance metrics) as well as the chance-corrected measures Cohen's (1960) kappa and Scott's (1955) pi. The measures based on alliance data come in two versions: one is based on valued alliance ties and the other is based on binary alliance ties. Data were last updated on December 7, 2017, and this description was [effectively plagiarized (with his blessing) from Frank HÃ¤ge's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ALVXLM&widget=dataverse@haege).

These data are directed dyad-years with 17 columns and 1,872,198 observations. They will almost certainly be the largest data set
I nudge/ask you to download remotely. The file containing this information is 18.6 MB in size. To reduce size further, these
decimal points have also been rounded to three spots.
