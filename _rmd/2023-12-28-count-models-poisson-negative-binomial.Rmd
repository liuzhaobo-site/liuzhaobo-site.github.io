Consider this a tutorial for second-year MA class on the Poisson model. It's a busy time of the year for me, juggling two MA classes by myself, supervising BA theses, and preparing for the next semester's classes.[^godthisishard] Part of the challenge this year has been overhauling the advanced MA class on quantitative methods to make it less about time series and as much about models students in international relations or economic history might encounter in their travels. On deck: regression models for the analysis of variables that "count". These are a unique case of discrete dependent variables that are left-bound at 0, can only be integers, and have only an informal bound on the right by probability. However, they present a unique opportunity because, if you were patient and diligent, you can extract some cool information from these models.

[^godthisishard]: I don't get a break from anything at the moment because your ability to get a break is conditioned on what research money you bring in. As a new hire, I don't have that yet, and the Swedes work all the way through Christmas. It's one of the largest culture shocks if you move here from the United States.

The topic for this post will be the Poisson model, which is kind of the "default" count model. There are others---i.e. negative binomial, hurdle, quasi-poisson, zero-inflated varieties---but we're going to be focused on the Poisson for this exercise. Consider this tutorial a means to understand the Poisson model, tame it, and make it work for you. We'll start with a discussion of the origins of this distribution and what it does in regression form. I'll give a simple example using simulated data before going to a (kind-of) real-world case analyzing the cross-national correlates of violent riots against the government. This is a code-heavy post, though some will be suppressed for presentation.

## What is the Poisson Distribution? {#whatis}

The Poisson distribution has an interesting origin story. Its name owes to [Simeon Denis Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%A9on_Denis_Poisson) because he introduced its basic theoretical intuition on a paper about wrongful convictions. In this application, Poisson was interested in a process for which the probability of an event occurring in a fixed time or space interval is small, but the number of trials is so large that the event occurs at least a few times. It was this same paper that Poisson coined the term ["law of large numbers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers) to describe the phenomenon that interested him.

The distribution is named after Poisson but the academic interest in the phenomenon he described (as a kind of probability distribution) has a more immediate cause that I find more interesting. The Prussian (German) military had a particularly frustrating problem with their cavalry units suffering casualties by way of friendly fire. The "friendly fire", in this case, was the horse itself. From 1875 to 1894, the Prussian military incurred 196 fatalities across 14 cavalry units caused by a horse kicking the cavalryman to death. In an 1898 paper, [Ladislaus Bortkiewicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladislaus_Bortkiewicz) found these deaths follow a Poisson distribution. [Reproduced later](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2348169) by luminaries in the United Kingdom like John Maynard Keynes and Harold Jeffreys, the Poisson distribution has become a pedagogical staple for modeling phenomena that are basic "counts" of "events". The distribution itself is flexible but the intuition is for modeling a count of events that are somewhat rare, discrete in nature (can only be [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) and not [reals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number)), hard-bound at the left by 0, and only informally bound on the right by what is conceivable/probable. In the Prussian horse-kicking example, most cavalry units, most of the time, don't experience death by horse-kicking. In a given year, some units may have 1 or 2. The 14th unit apparently had 4 in 1882. You don't ever expect to observe something like 30 horse-kicking deaths in a given year, given this kind of "rate" of occurrence.

The Poisson distribution itself is deceptively simple. For any proposed integer $$y$$ between 0 and, I suppose, $$\infty$$, the probability of realizing $$y$$ as $$Y$$ is a function of just one parameter: $$\lambda$$. $$\lambda$$ determines both the mean of the counts and the variance as well. It's formalized as follows:

$$
Pr(Y = y) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{y}}{y!}
$$

You can use `rpois()` in R to simulate the kind of data that assorted $$\lambda$$s would produce.

```{r example-poisson-distributions}
n <- 10000
set.seed(8675309)
tibble(`lambda = .1` = rpois(n, .1),
       `lambda = 1` = rpois(n, 1),
       `lambda = 3` = rpois(n, 3),
       `lambda = 5` = rpois(n, 5),
       `lambda = 10` = rpois(n, 10),
       `lambda = 100` = rpois(n,100)) %>%
  gather(var, val) %>%
  mutate(var = fct_inorder(var)) %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(val)) +
  geom_bar(alpha=0.8, color='black', fill=g_c('su_water')) +
  facet_wrap(~var, scales='free') +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) +
  labs(title = "Examples of Poisson Distributions, Given Varied Lambda Parameters",
       subtitle = "Poisson distributions always return non-negative integers, but higher values of lambda look 'more normal'.",
       x = "Integers (Counts)", y = "Number of Observed Integers",
       caption = "Data generated randomly from a Poisson distribution. N = 10,000.")
  
```

$$\lambda$$ in this formulation is a kind of "intensity" parameter determining the number of events that occur and its baseline rate of occurrence. However, we don't have access to this parameter directly and can only model it based on the count of events it produces. This is what the Poisson regression is trying to accomplish: modeling the intensity parameter that produces the count of events. Because counts are hard-bound at the left by 0, $$\lambda$$ can only be positive. To ensure that $$\lambda$$ is positive in the regression form, we typically represent it as $$\lambda = exp(X\beta)$$. If you want to "undo" that exponential term on the right-hand side of the equation, [you'd take a natural logarithmic transformation of it](http://svmiller.com/blog/2023/01/what-log-variables-do-for-your-ols-model/#aside). However, that makes $$\lambda$$ to be a log-transformed expected value that is at linear in its regression form.

## A Simple Example with Fake Data {#simple}

You can simulate fake data to underscore the intuition as to what the Poisson regression model is doing here. `Example` is a simple data set we're going to create where there is just one independent variable (`x`, a binary variable). $$\lambda$$, the "intensity" parameter, is simulated as `exp(1 + .5x)` and the outcome `y` is going to be a simulated count of events that this $$\lambda$$ would produce. The data would look like this.


```{r}
tibble(x = sample(c(0:1), 100, replace=TRUE),
       lambda = exp(1 + .5*x),
       y = rpois(100, lambda)) -> Example

Example
Example %>% count(y)
```

You could capture faithfully capture this data-generating process with the `glm()` function in R. You might be accustomed to this function for the case of simpler binary logistic regressions, but it's a simple matter of changing one argument in the function (the `family` argument).

```{r}
M1 <- glm(y ~ x, Example,
          family = poisson())
summary(M1)
```

Let's walk through what this output is telling us, beyond the obvious matter of whether `x` is significantly different than 0. First, let's take a look at this summary of the data set we created. Briefly, this code is creating the mean of *y* by *x*, which is convenient and easy here because *x* is binary. After calculating the mean of *y*, we'll take a log-transformation of it, get differences of the log transformations, and create a kind of percentage change of them by taking the difference of the means, divided over the mean of counts where *x* is 0. Hopefully you can spot some things that look familiar.

```{r}
Example %>%
  summarize(mean_y = mean(y),
            log_my = log(mean_y),
            .by = x) %>%  
  arrange(x) %>%
  mutate(d_log_my = log_my - lag(log_my),
         irr = ifelse(row_number() == 1, 
                      ((lead(mean_y)-mean_y)/mean_y)+1,
                      exp(d_log_my)),
         pc = irr*mean_y[1]) %>%
  data.frame
```

See the *y*-intercept in the regression equation? It's the log-transformed mean of events when all right-hand side variables are 0. There is only one right-hand side variable here (`x`), and it's helpfully binary for ease of illustration. See the difference in the logged means? That's the regression coefficient for *x* in this context. It's the difference in logged mean of events for a one-unit increase in *x*. Because *x* in this simple example is binary, and it's the only *x* in the model, the quantity returned in this transformation is straightforward. Notice the `irr` variable? This is a simple exponentiation of the logged differences (c.f. an exponentiation of your Poisson coefficient), communicated alongside the proportional change (+1, because the effect is positive). You may sometimes see as something called an "incidence rate ratio". All else equal, you can use this as a multiplicative factor roughly communicating the percent change in the response for a unit change in *x*. In our simple case, the mean of *y* when *x* is 0 is 3.05. Multiply that by the incidence rate ratio in our simple model and you get the mean of *y* when *x* is 1. Alternatively, the effect of *x* going from 0 to 1 is to increase the mean of expected counts by about 58.59%.


## An Actual Example: Anti-Government Riots and the "Youth Bulge" {#youthbulge}

The example above is a simple toy example to get you acclimated to the Poisson model. Now, [it's owl-drawing time](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/572078-how-to-draw-an-owl). Preparing for this class I'm teaching right now reminded me of the Cross-National Time Series (CNTS) Database, which I know fairly well for its data on domestic conflict events. Every year for which it is available, for all territorial units it covers, CNTS records the number of assassinations, general strikes, incidences of guerrilla warfare, government crises, purges, riots, revolutions, and anti-government demonstrations. I select the data here to 2012 as part of the [`DCE12` that is forthcoming in `{stevedata}`](http://svmiller.com/stevedata/reference/DCE12.html). For 2012, they look something like this. 

```r
DCE12 %>%
  select(assassinations:agd) %>%
  gather(var, val) %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(as.factor(val))) + 
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~var, scales='free')
```
```{r domestic-conflict-events-2012-cnts, echo=F}
DCE12 %>%
  select(assassinations:agd) %>%
  setNames(.,c("Assassinations", "Strikes", "Guerrilla Warfare",
               "Govt. Crises", "Purges", "Riots", "Revolutions",
               "Anti-Government Demonstrations")) %>%
  gather(var, val) %>%
  mutate(var = fct_inorder(var)) %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(as.factor(val))) + 
  geom_bar(alpha=.8, fill=g_c("su_water"), color='black') +
  facet_wrap(~var, scales='free') +
  labs(title = "The Distribution of Assorted Domestic Conflict Events in 2012",
       subtitle = "These data are typically overdispersed, but let's cross that bridge when we get to it.",
       x = "Count of Events in 2012", y = "Number of Observations",
       caption = "Data: ?DCE12 in {stevedata} by way of the Cross-National Time Series (CNTS) Database.")
```

They look like the kind of count data you'd teach around, minus some polite concerns about overdispersion I'll deal with later.

Let's evaluate an argument I came across preparing for this class. What explains the incidence of anti-government demonstrations and riots? Let's treat, for now, anti-government demonstrations as strictly peaceful and riots as strictly focused toward the government in this application. [Sawyeret al. (2022)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10693971211059762) propose a theoretical model that emphasizes the importance of the "youth bulge" and urbanization as important correlates of both peaceful demonstrations against the government (anti-government demonstrations) and violent demonstrations against the government (riots). Their model of choice is a two-way fixed effects---[which, groan](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0231349)---negative binomial panel model. I'm going to explore this in a simple cross-sectional case because the goal is just about unpacking the Poisson model and not about questioning whether their findings are robust or not.

Let's prepare `DCE12` for analysis in light of the information that Sawyer et al. (2022) also included in their model. I'm going to focus on just the `riots` variable here to minimize an issue I know I'll have to deal with anyway (i.e. overdispersion). I'm going to model the youth bulge as they do, which is the proportion of the population aged 15-29 over the total adult population. I'm going to multiply that by 100 to convert a proportion to a percentage. I'm going to include a variable that is the percentage of the population of the territorial unit living in urban areas. Another variable of interest here is the percentage of tertiary school-aged population enrolled in tertiary school, which comes by way of [Barro and Lee (2015)](https://barrolee.github.io/BarroLeeDataSet/Enroll.html). I might intermittently call this a "university enrollment rate" because that's what it's basically measuring, in as many words, and to the best of its ability. One assumes: more university-aged people in university, the more riots (a la the classic stories we tell about the United States during the Vietnam War). Other variables: Varieties of Democracy's electoral democracy index ("polyarchy"), and the natural logarithmic transformations of total population size and GDP per capita. I'm going to subset the data to just complete cases to make this easier for me.

```{r}

DCE12 %>%
  mutate(youth_bulge = (youthpop/adultpop)*100) %>%
  select(iso2c, country, riots,
         youth_bulge, gdppc, urbanshare, polyarchy,
         perctser, tpop) %>% na.omit %>%
  log_at(c("gdppc", "tpop")) -> Data

# Simple lookie-loo.
Data %>% 
  select(-iso2c, -country, -tpop, -gdppc) %>%
  summary()
```

Now, let's run a simple Poisson regression model. The code snippet below returns the pertinent information, though I'm going to quietly format this into a handsome regression table with `{modelsummary}`.

```r
summary(M2 <- glm(riots  ~ youth_bulge + urbanshare +
            perctser + polyarchy + 
            ln_tpop + 
            ln_gdppc, Data, family='poisson'))
```


<div id="modelsummary">
```{r, echo=F}
M2 <- glm(riots  ~ youth_bulge + urbanshare +
            perctser + polyarchy + 
            ln_tpop + 
            ln_gdppc, Data, family='poisson')

modelsummary(list("Poisson" = M2,
                  "Poisson (IRR)" = M2),
             exponentiate = c(FALSE, TRUE),
             stars = TRUE,
             gof_map = c("nobs"),
             caption = "An Event Count Analysis of Riots in 2012",
             coef_map = c(
               "youth_bulge" = "Youth Bulge",
               "urbanshare" = "% Urban",
               "perctser" = "Rate of Students in Tertiary School",
               "polyarchy" = "Electoral Democracy Index (Polyarchy)",
               "ln_tpop" = "Total Population (Logged)",
               "ln_gdppc" = "GDP per Capita (Logged)",
               "(Intercept)" = "Intercept"
             )) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE)
```

</div>

Okay, let's walk through what this model is telling you, with respect to the inputs. First, I try to caution students to [be kind to your intercept](http://svmiller.com/blog/2020/04/post-estimation-simulation-trump-vote-midwest/), but I was not here. Thus, my formal interpretation of the y-intercept is that the expected, log-transformed mean of counts for a given observation where there is no youth population whatsoever, no one lives in an urban area, no one of university age is enrolled in university, the country is a maximum non-democracy, the logged population size is 0 (i.e. the territorial unit has just 1,000 people because the variable is in the 1000s), and the average GDP per capita is 0, comes out to -5.482. Exponentiating that suggests the mean of events for that hypothetical hellscape is .004 or so. Hey, you asked for it, and [we can always fix it in post](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixItInPost). Had you centered your variables, you could've returned something usable here.

"Significance" is done as usual. In this simple model, we don't see any "youth bulge" effect, nor do we see a discernible effect of the percentage of the population living in urban areas. The GDP per capita variable also has no noticeable effect on the expected count of riots in 2012. We do, however, see significant effects of the tertiary school rate variable, the democracy variable, and the population size variable.

But, let's talk how you should interpret the outputs for the stuff that is significant. The rate of students in tertiary school (i.e. university) is positive and significant. All else equal, a unit increase in this variable (e.g. going from 50% of the tertiary school-aged population enrolled in tertiary school to 51%) increases the expected log counts of riots by .018. This effect is "statistically significant" and thus unlikely to be 0. Should you exponentiate that regression coefficient, you get back the incidence rate ratio. Multiply that by the incidence rate ratio and you get a mean of counts following the unit increase in this variable. For example, the mean of *y* in the data is 1.462. Multiply that number by the incidence rate ratio and you get 1.488. That would follow across the data, all else equal. Just be mindful that because it "looks small" belies the large scale here.

The democracy variable is negative and statistically significant, suggesting that more democratic states are less likely to have violent riots. What's unique about this variable is that the unit change of 0 to 1 is also a min/max effect. It's the hypothetical effect of going from, say, a hyper North Korea to a Sweden on steroids (or something hyperbolic to that effect). That effect is to decrease the logged counts of riots by -.774. The incidence rate ratio is .461. If, for example, the rate of riots is 1.462, then the adjusted rate in light of this min/max effect is now about .67 (i.e. $$1.462*exp(-.774) = .673$$). Because this effect is negative, you can approximate this by taking 1 - the incidence rate ratio, and multiply that by 100, to get the percentage change. In other words, $$(1.462 - .673)/1.462 = .539$$. That, multiplied by 100, approximates the 1 - the incidence rate ratio, also multiplied by 100.

Let's round home by looking at the total population variable. This variable is itself logged, so [I'm going to be careful here](http://svmiller.com/blog/2023/01/what-log-variables-do-for-your-ols-model/). A unit change on the log scale of the total population variable (i.e. multiplying it by Leonhard Euler's constant) coincides with an estimated change in the logged number of riots by .608. Exponentiated as an incidence rate ratio, this is 1.836. So, let's walk it back and do it again. If our expected mean rate of riots was 1.462, we'd multiply that by 1.836 to get a new expected mean rate of riots following a unit increase in logged population size (which, again, think proportionally here). That comes out to 2.684. That percentage change would be about 83.6%, which is also what the incidence rate ratio is basically telling you.

## Getting Quantities of Interest from the Poisson Model {#qi}

You'd be forgiven for not having a lot of fun with interpreting the Poisson model on its own terms, so let's have some fun with it. We see that the tertiary school rate variable is significant and positive, suggesting at least something in spirit of the Sawyer et al. (2022) argument and my crude gesturing toward the violent, student-led riots in the United States against the Vietnam War (see also [my more thorough analysis of this from the terrorism perspective](http://svmiller.com/blog/2019/08/us-terrorism-ideology-analysis-1970s/)). We also saw some interesting variation in these data from the summary output above. The 25th percentile is 11.77% (about where Lesotho is) and the 75th percentile is 62.69% (about where the United Kingdom or Uruguay are). What is the expected number of riots for the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile, holding everything else at some fixed value, given the partial effects communicated in the model? Do note this simple exercise is going to ignore estimation uncertainty---topic for another time and place, [if I ever had the goddamn time](http://svmiller.com/simqi/)---though we can do this quickly with the `predict()` function alongside assistance from the wonderful `{modelr}` package.

First, let's create a hypothetical prediction grid, holding everything else at the median, and allowing the tertiary school enrollment rate variable to assume the 25th and 75th percentile.


```{r}

Data %>%
  data_grid(.model = M2,
            perctser = c(
              quantile(perctser, .25),
              quantile(perctser, .75)
            )) -> newdat


newdat # let's take a look at our grid
```

Now, let's use the `predict()` function to estimate the mean of expected counts, given the model input. Remember from our treatment above: this is the model's estimate of $$\lambda$$.

```{r}
newdat %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(M2, 
                        newdata=newdat, type='response')) -> Pred

Pred %>% pull(pred) -> ll

ll
```

Here, the estimated $$\lambda$$ for the 25th percentile (fixing everything else at the median) is .518. The estimated $$\lambda$$ for the 75th percentile is 1.287. If you had an eagle eye, you could potentially see that the difference between the 75th and 25th percentile (i.e. about 50.92) is being multiplied by the coefficient for this variable (i.e .018). That product is then exponentiated and multiplied by the $$\lambda$$ of the 25th percentile to produce the $$\lambda$$ of the 75th percentile. tl;dr. have the computer do it for you, but this is what it's doing.

Okie doke, let's now create a tibble of a hypothetical prediction grid, leveraging what we've done so far and what I kind of know about Poisson distributions can generate given the $$\lambda$$s I got. We're going to use `dpois()` to calculate the probability of observing 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 riots in a given year (2012) with the $$\lambda$$s we got. Code, suppressed for presentation, will make a pretty plot.

```{r}
tibble(x = 0:5,
       p_25 = dpois(x, ll[1]),
       p_75 = dpois(x,ll[2]))
```

```{r probability-of-riots-poisson, echo=F}
tibble(x = 0:5,
       p_25 = dpois(x, ll[1]),
       p_75 = dpois(x,ll[2])) %>%
  gather(var, val, -x) %>%

The Poisson regression coefficient communicates the estimated change in logged mean counts for a unit change in the independent variable. The incidence rate ratio exponentiates that to return a multiplicative effect for a unit change with respect to some baseline mean rate. You can also extract the percentage change from the mean rate with that information as well. You can always see what the effect "looks like" with respect to the probability of some count. In this case, the change from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile decreases the probability of no riots from .595 to .276, a change in probability of .319 and a percentage change in probability of 53.6%. The change in probability of one riot doesn't change much, but change in probability of two riots changes considerably. The probability of two riots for the 25th percentile is .08. For the 75th percentile, it's .229. That is a change in probability of .149, and a percentage change in probability of about 186%. All told, the probability of more than one riot changes from about .096 to .369, a percentage change in probability of about 284%. That's perhaps pertinent information for you to know in your research (if you had this exact topic), and again subject to faithfully modeling uncertainty.


## The Problem of Overdispersion {#overdispersion}

Beyond all the other things you should think about in your model (e.g. independence of observations, strict exogeneity), the Poisson model has one major assumption that you should check. In the Poisson case, there is just the one parameter ($$\lambda$$) that is both the mean and the variance. The assumption here is typically called "equidispersion", and it might be easier to spot potential issues by looking at clear instances of over- or underdispersion. Overdispersed data have large tails, kind of like the anti-government demonstration variable. Underdispersed data are far skinnier than they should be. In the Poisson distribution examples above, imagine the case where $$\lambda$$ was 100 but the minimums and maximums were between 90 and 110 to be an instance of underdispersion. In this case, the variance is smaller than the mean. In the case where $$\lambda$$ was 3, imagine seeing a tail that included 15-25. In that case, the variance is greater than the mean.

If I'm being honest, I started exploring this model in greater detail because I'm having to teach an around an econometrics textbook and I found it kind of fascinating that this appears to be the one boilerplate GLM that econometricians seem to really love. It's the same people for whom you'll grimace your way through a discussion of the "linear probability model" but the Poisson gets an honest treatment and a vigorous defense. [Jeff Wooldridge really loves it](https://twitter.com/jmwooldridge/status/1363828456136523779?lang=en), even if it comes with this (on paper) really rigid assumption about equidispersion. It comes with a juxtaposition to the more general negative binomial model (among a few others that I really don't want to get into at the moment). The negative binomial model has a different variance parameter than its mean parameter, and another way of thinking about it is that the Poisson distribution is [a special case of the negative binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution#Poisson_distribution) where the dispersion parameter goes to 0. Without saying too much about it, you can think of the negative binomial distribution as [a hook-up between a Gamma distribution and a Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution#Gamma%E2%80%93Poisson_mixture) at a house party.

There is an overdispersion test (in the `{AER}` package) that you can do, but honestly, just estimate the negative binomial model anyway and compare it to the Poisson. Extract the log-likelihood of the negative binomial and subtract from it the log-likelihood of the Poisson model. You can calculate a likelihood ratio test statistic as equal to twice the absolute difference in log-likelihoods. Cross-referenced to a $$\chi$$-squared distribution with a degree of freedom (i.e. because of the addition of the dispersion parameter, $$\theta$$), it can tell you if the negative binomial model is fitting the data as well as the Poisson or better. If it's fitting the data better, it's strongly implied it's because of the dispersion parameter.

`lrtest()` in `{lmtest}` will do all this for you.


```{r}

M3 <- MASS::glm.nb(riots  ~ youth_bulge + urbanshare + perctser + polyarchy + 
            ln_tpop + 
            ln_gdppc, Data)

lrtest(M3, M2)
```

What you do with this is up to you. The econometricians who love the Poisson model will tell you---and they have a point---that this concerns the variance and not the mean, per se. Saying you can't use the Poisson model because of the variance is analogous to saying you can't use the linear model and the OLS estimator because of heteroskedasticity. Since the assumption is conditional and not marginal, eye-balling the distribution of the raw dependent variable can only suggest it for you (and not prove it to you). So, you can slap on a standard error correction based on dicking around the variance-covariance matrix to make the standard errors "robust". Something like this would do.

```r
coeftest(M2, vcov=robust)
```

`{modelsummary}` can do this for you automatically underneath the hood. For what it's worth, I lose track of all these assorted on-the-fly standard error corrections pretty quickly so you should explore your options here. I'm also of the mentality that [if it can be bootstrapped, it should be bootstrapped](http://svmiller.com/blog/2020/03/bootstrap-standard-errors-in-r/). But, again, topic for another day.


<div id="modelsummary">
```{r, echo=F}

modelsummary(list("Poisson" = M2,
                  "Poisson (IRR)" = M2,
                  "Neg. Bin." = M3,
                  "Poisson (Robust)" = M2),
             exponentiate = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),
             vcov  = c("classical", "classical", "classical", "robust"),
             stars = TRUE,
             gof_map = c("nobs"),
             caption = "An Event Count Analysis of Riots in 2012",
             coef_map = c(
               "youth_bulge" = "Youth Bulge",
               "urbanshare" = "% Urban",
               "perctser" = "Rate of Students in Tertiary School",
               "polyarchy" = "Electoral Democracy Index (Polyarchy)",
               "ln_tpop" = "Total Population (Logged)",
               "ln_gdppc" = "GDP per Capita (Logged)",
               "(Intercept)" = "Intercept"
             )) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE)
```

</div>

What you do with the differences in sign and significance is your call. In the case of the democracy variable, I already know it's because that should be a square term (c.f. ["more violence in the middle"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12373))

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

This post is not exhaustive of all count models. There are really nifty things you can do with hurdle models, in particular. However, there's real value in starting with the Poisson given its relative simplicity. Just understand that that Poisson model is conceptualizing an "intensity" parameter ($$\lambda$$) that is generating the events in a given fixed time/space and the quantities returned by the Poisson model are logged estimates of $$\lambda$$ and what accounts for unit changes in it. You can exponentiate the coefficients as incidence rate ratios, which also communicate percentage changes in the mean of the events. It's easier to see what this does in simple cases. In more general cases, you want quantities of interest that correspond with the output of the Poisson model.
