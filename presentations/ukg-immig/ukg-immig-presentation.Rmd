### A Regression Roadmap

Regression as we use it is a combination of hypothesis-testing and story-telling.

1. Know the bigger picture/puzzle.
1. Know the data.
2. Understand what the regression table is saying.
3. Understand what the regression table *isn't* saying.

## Know the Bigger Picture/Puzzle
### Know the Bigger Picture/Puzzle

How positively do British people regard immigration/immigrants?

\begin{center}Why is this important? How can we know?\end{center}

## Know the Data
### Know the Data

Scan the research design section for the following information:

1. The (primary) source of the data
2. The **unit of analysis** (i.e. who/what is being studied)
3. The **dependent variable** (i.e. the variable to be explained)
4. The **independent variable(s)** (i.e. what we be believe explains the dependent variable)

### Know the Data

1. The **data:** European Social Survey (2018) for the UK
2. The **unit of analysis:** the individual respondent in the survey
    - Note: I subset the analysis to just those who were born in the UK.

### Know the Data

The **dependent variable** (*DV*) is an additive index [0:30] of three prompts:

- Is it generally bad or good for the UK’s economy that immigrants come to live here? 
    - (`imbgeco`) [0:10; bad:good]
- Is the UK’s cultural life is generally undermined or enriched by immigrants? 
    - (`imueclt`) [0:10; undermined:enriched]
- Is the UK made a worse or a better place to live by immigrants?
    - (`imwbcnt`) [0:10; worse:better]

Higher values = more pro-immigration sentiment.

       title = "A Bar Chart of Pro-Immigration Sentiment in the United Kingdom from the ESS Data (Round 9)",
       subtitle = "There's a natural heaping of 0s and 30s but the mean (16.891) approximates the median (17). I'd feel comfortable communicating exact differences on this scale.")
```

### Know the Data

The **independent variables** (*IVs*):

- *Age* (in years)
- *Education* (in years of education)
- *Gender* (1 if respondent is a woman)
- *Employment status* (1 if respondent is unemployed, but looking for work)
- *Household income* (in deciles)
- *Ideology* (on 11-point L-R scale)

### Know the Data

| **Variable**  | **Mean**  | **Std. Dev.**  | **Median** | **Min.** | **Max.** | **N** |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| *Immigration Sentiment*  |  16.891 | 6.991  | 17 | 0 | 30 | 1850  |
| *Age*  | 53.673  | 18.392  | 55 | 15 | 90 |  1893   |
| *Female*  | .541  | .011  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1905  |
| *Years of Education*  | 14.049  | 3.630  | 13 |  3 | 41 | 1893  |
| *Unemployed*  | .019  |  .003  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1905  |
| *Household Income (Deciles)*  | 5.171  | 2.972 | 5 | 1 | 10 | 1615  |
| *Ideology (L to R)*  | 4.96  | 1.945 | 5 |  0 | 10 |1726  |

Table: Descriptive Statistics for the Variables in Our Regression

## Understand What the Regression is Saying
###  Understand What the Regression is Saying

**(Linear/OLS) Regression** is a tool for understanding a phenomenon of interest (immigration sentiment) as a linear function of some combination of predictors.

- Strong resemblance to the slope-intercept equation (`y = mx + b`)
- Flexible to include multiple predictors (i.e. **multiple regression**)

###  Understand What the Regression is Saying

We believe we can explain the *DV* for an individual ($i$) as:

\begin{eqnarray}
\textrm{Immigration Sentiment} &=& \beta_0 + \beta_1*\textrm{Age} + \beta_2*\textrm{Female} + \beta_3*\textrm{Years of Education} +   \nonumber \\
   &&   \beta_4*\textrm{Unemployed} +  \beta_5*\textrm{Household Income} +  \nonumber \\
   &&  \beta_6*\textrm{Ideology} + \epsilon \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

Of note:

- $\beta_0$: estimated immigration sentiment when all predictors are set to zero (i.e. *y*-intercept)
- $\beta_{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$: estimated slopes of each *IV* on the *DV*
- $\epsilon$: prediction errors, an unmeasured variable

M1 <- lm(immigsent ~ agea + female + eduyrs + uempla + hinctnta  + lrscale, data=ESS9GB)

stargazer(M1, type="latex",
          style="ajps", header=FALSE,
          font.size="small",
          covariate.labels = c("Age","Female","Years of Education", "Unemployed", "Household Income (Deciles)", "Ideology (L to R)"),
          title="A Simple OLS Model of Pro-Immigration Sentiment in the United Kingdom",
         #  notes="<small>Data: ESS, Round 9 (United Kingdom)</small>",
          dep.var.labels="Pro-Immigration Sentiment",
          omit.stat = c("aic","ll", "rsq", "adj.rsq", "f","ser"))
```


### Unpacking the Regression Table

Take stock of three things from a regression table:

1. The numbers inside parentheses next to a variable.
2. The numbers *not* in parentheses next to a variable.
3. Some of those numbers not in parentheses have some asterisks next to them.

Let's start with the second item.

### The Regression Coefficient

The number *not* inside a parentheses is a **regression coefficient**.

- These communicated the *estimated* change in the *DV* for a one-unit change in a particular *IV*.
- They are the betas ($\beta$) in the formula.
- The "Constant" is the *y*-intercept ($\beta_0$).

Use the coefficients to assess **negative** and **positive relationships**.

- **Positive:** as an *IV* increases, the *DV* also increases (and vice-versa).
- **Negative:** as an *IV* decreases, the *DV* increases (and vice-versa).

###

```{r reg-table-2, echo=F, eval=T, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 8.5, warning = F, message = F, results="asis"}
M1 <- lm(immigsent ~ agea + female + eduyrs + uempla + hinctnta  + lrscale, data=ESS9GB)

stargazer(M1, type="latex",
          style="ajps", header=FALSE,
          font.size="small",
          covariate.labels = c("Age","Female","Years of Education", "Unemployed", "Household Income (Deciles)", "Ideology (L to R)"),
          title="A Simple OLS Model of Pro-Immigration Sentiment in the United Kingdom",
         #  notes="<small>Data: ESS, Round 9 (United Kingdom)</small>",
          dep.var.labels="Pro-Immigration Sentiment",
          omit.stat = c("aic","ll", "rsq", "adj.rsq", "f","ser"))
```

### The Standard Error

The number inside parentheses is the **standard error** of the regression coefficient.

- i.e. it's a measure of uncertainty around the estimate.

However, this is not an important quality by itself.

- It depends on its relationship with the regression coefficient.

<!-- This leads to the third item of interest. -->

### The Asterisks

The asterisks are an indicator of **statistical significance**.

- Divide the regression coefficient over its standard error.
- This gives you a **t-statistic**.
- If the absolute value of the **t-statistic** is greater than 1.96 ("about 2"), you can feel confident rejecting a claim of zero.

**tl;dr**: what is the probability of us observing this coefficient and standard error if the true effect is zero?

- The asterisks are your visual cue to identify a "statistically significant" effect.

In our case, only education, income, and ideology have statistically significant effects.


###

```{r reg-table-3, echo=F, eval=T, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 8.5, warning = F, message = F, results="asis"}
M1 <- lm(immigsent ~ agea + female + eduyrs + uempla + hinctnta  + lrscale, data=ESS9GB)

stargazer(M1, type="latex",
          style="ajps", header=FALSE,
          font.size="small",
          covariate.labels = c("Age","Female","Years of Education", "Unemployed", "Household Income (Deciles)", "Ideology (L to R)"),
          title="A Simple OLS Model of Pro-Immigration Sentiment in the United Kingdom",
         #  notes="<small>Data: ESS, Round 9 (United Kingdom)</small>",
          dep.var.labels="Pro-Immigration Sentiment",
          omit.stat = c("aic","ll", "rsq", "adj.rsq", "f","ser"))
```

## Understand What the Regression Table *Isn't* Saying
### Understand What the Regression Table *Isn't* Saying

1. The "constant" (or *y*-intercept) is not a "variable."
    - It's just an estimate of *y* when everything else is zero.
2. The regression table doesn't test the regression model's multiple assumptions.
    - Look at your data and your model.
3. "Statistically significant is not itself 'significant.'"
    - "Significance" says nothing about the magnitude of the effect, only if you can discern it from zero.
4. More asterisks do not mean "more significance."
    - It won't tell you if one effect is greater than another, only that it's more precise.
    
## Conclusion
### Conclusion

Regression is both hypothesis-testing and story-telling. Some takeaways:

1. Make sure you're reading about the bigger picture/puzzle.
2. Take stock of the data.
    - (i.e. *DV*, *IVs*, unit of analysis, and data source).
3. Evaluate a regression table you read by the direction of the relationship (+ or -) and what effects are "significant."
4. Internalize what the regression table *isn't* telling you.
    - (i.e. magnitude effects, whether the model's assumptions are met).
